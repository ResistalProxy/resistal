    <h2>Traktor</h2>
    <p>
        Traktor is an Orbot alternative that supports devices running the latest Android. Traktor protects network traffic using The Onion Router (Tor) network. Tor encrypts the data and sends it through random points across the world to hide where the connection started. For example, while using Traktor, a website you visit might think you're looking at it from another country.
        <br>
        To benefit from Traktor, you must configure your apps to use it as a proxy. Traktor provides a local Socks5 proxy on port 9050 and an HTTP proxy on port 8118.
        <br>
        For the Telegram app: Settings -&gt; Data and Storage -&gt; Proxy Settings -&gt; Add Proxy -&gt; SOCKS5 Proxy -&gt; Server: 127.0.0.1 (or localhost) and Proxy Port to 9050.
        <br>
        For the Twitter app: Settings -&gt; Enable HTTP Proxy -&gt; set Proxy Host to localhost and Proxy Port to 8118.
